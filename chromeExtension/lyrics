c            Am              G
Here we are, staring at each other
Am                               F             C
And I dont wanna miss what you're lips have to say
C                       Am                G
The nights still rising, and luck's by my side
Am           F             C
And how, how you'd melt in arms, in a blink of an eye



Dm                       G
let this love carry your soul
Dm                        F              C
and you'll forget all the bad things you know
C        Am          F            G
I don't, I don't say that who I am
Dm                    G                    C
coz now that you're here let me hold your hand





now we reach to the place where we say that

I love you in our very own way.

While you do your thing with your eyes

My heart stops and I can't look away.




let this love take on your soul

and you'll forget all the bad things you know

I cant, I cant say that wo I am

coz now that you're here my mind's gonna blow



               C
So before your mom calls
           G
before the hands fall
           F         Am
before the sun comes out
                Em
and says you to walk through the wall



Before the warmth ends

and all the time that we've spent

flies away like
           Em            G
a matter of small seconds
